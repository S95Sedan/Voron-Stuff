This mod is a rework the git below but instead for a waveshare 4.3" DSI display;<br>
https://github.com/Print-Up/Hyperpixel-4-Mount-for-Voron-2.4

Currently only for 350 or 400mm width.<br>

- Uses the standard m3 voron heat inserts (M3x4x5mm) and M3 x5mm/8mm bolts for the connecting skirt parts.<br>
- The screen is installed with M2.5x6mm to the backplate and secured with 2x M2x8mm and 2x M3x8mm bolts to the front plate.
