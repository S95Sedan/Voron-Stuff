(Note: Needs an additional hole to tighten the extrusion screws)

Files are a rework from this mod:
https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_Other_Printer_Mods/tree/master/VORON_Printers/Reinforced_Gantry_Mounts

Limit switch and Hall-Effect mounts have been aligned by the Voron 2.4 CAD files, they may need some minor adjustments as they havent been tested on a machine yet.
Parts are the same as the original, besides from the main body. It's advisable to use a M3x14 or M3x16 BHCS for belt clamp for clearance reasons.

Recommended Hardware:
- 4x Ball head screws (M5) (02152)
- 4/8x M5 Washers (1mm Thick) (Use 1 or 2 washers on each)
- 4x M10x20 Grub Screw (Flat End) (DIN913/ISO4026)
- 16x M3x12 (DIN912)
- 4x M3x16 (DIN912)
